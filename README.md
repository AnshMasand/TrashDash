# TrashDash
We have created an app to pick up trash and reward users for it. The project was made using html, css, javascript and googlemaps API. It uses firebase for storage.

- Given the time constraint of our mid-term exams we were unable to make a final product. However we enjoyed the oppurtunity provided to us. We will continue working on it and will keep this github repository updated. 

Deadline for completion - 4 months
